## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security vulnerabilities are taken seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

Instead, please report them using one of the following methods:

    - Click "Report a vulnerability"
    - Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

2. **Alternative: Private email**
    - If you cannot use GitHub's private reporting, contact the project maintainers via the contact email listed on the GitHub profile

- **Impact Assessment** - Your assessment of the severity and potential impact
- **Suggested Fix** - If you have ideas for mitigation or remediation (optional)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgement** - I will acknowledge receipt of your report within 5 business days
