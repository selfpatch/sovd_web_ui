## How to Contribute Code

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork the repository** and clone your fork locally
2. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive name:
   - `feature/short-description` for new features
   - `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
   - `docs/short-description` for documentation changes
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Make your changes** following the project's coding standards
5. **Test your changes** locally: `npm run dev`
6. **Run linting**: `npm run lint`
7. **Build the project**: `npm run build`
8. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages
9. **Push your branch** to your fork
10. **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of this repository

### Commit Messages

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove")
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add a blank line followed by a more detailed explanation if needed

Examples:
```
Add server connection dialog with URL validation

Fix entity tree not expanding on click

Update documentation for Docker deployment
```

### Build and Test Requirements

Before opening or updating a Pull Request, you **must**:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run linting:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. Build the project successfully:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Ensure the app works locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code follows the repository's style and conventions
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] New functionality has been tested manually
- [ ] Documentation is updated where applicable
- [ ] PR description clearly explains what changed and why
- [ ] Related issue is referenced (e.g., "Fixes #123")

### Code Review Process

- The project maintainers will review pull requests as time permits
- Address review feedback promptly
- Keep discussions professional and constructive
- Be patient - maintainers may need time to review

## What NOT to Contribute

- **Purely cosmetic changes** that don't add functionality (whitespace, formatting without other changes)
- **Large refactors** without prior discussion - open an issue first
- **Breaking changes** without coordination with maintainers
- **Code that doesn't pass linting** or breaks existing functionality
