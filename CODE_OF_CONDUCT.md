# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in all communication
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being open to different perspectives and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or abusive language
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by:

- Using GitHub's "Report abuse" feature on the repository
- Contacting the project maintainers via the repository's security contact listed in `SECURITY.md`
- Opening a confidential issue if you feel comfortable doing so

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
